# Vox-Splat.io Project Summary

## Project Overview
Vox-Splat.io is a web-based 3D point cloud viewer application built with React, Three.js, and React Three Fiber. The application aims to provide a professional-grade, Blender-like experience for viewing and manipulating point cloud data.

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. Viewport and Display
- Dynamic resizing of the viewer to fill available space
- Professional Blender-like viewport appearance with dark theme
- Full-screen viewing capability
- Grid display toggle
- High-performance point cloud rendering using React Three Fiber

### 2. Camera Controls
- Implemented OrbitControls from Three.js
- Fixed gimbal lock-like behavior
- Mouse controls:
  - Left button: Rotate
  - Right button: Pan
  - Middle button/wheel: Zoom
- Smooth camera movement
- Touch controls support

### 3. UI Components
- Modern, semi-transparent styling with blur effects
- Draggable properties window showing:
  - File name
  - File format
  - File size
  - Point count
  - Bounds information
- Removed point count from top-right corner for cleaner UI
- Implemented using react-draggable

### 4. Point Cloud Manipulation
- Point size adjustment per object
- Visibility toggles
- Object highlighting
- Selection tools:
  - Box select
  - Brush select (with adjustable size)
  - Lasso select

### Key Technologies
- React + TypeScript
- Three.js + React Three Fiber
- @react-three/drei for enhanced Three.js components
- react-draggable for window management

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient point cloud rendering using BufferGeometry
- Proper cleanup and resource management
- Optimized viewport updates

## Styling Details
- Dark theme with accent colors:
  - Primary: #60a5fa
  - Primary Dark: #3b82f6
  - Background: #0a0a0a
  - Surface: #1a1a1a
  - Surface Light: #2d2d2d
- Semi-transparent UI elements with blur effects
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Modern, minimal aesthetic

## Current State
The application is functional with core features implemented. Users can:
1. Load PLY and Splat files
2. View and manipulate point clouds
3. Adjust display properties
4. Use selection tools
5. Toggle grid and fullscreen modes

## Known Issues
1. @types/react-draggable failed to install but functionality works
2. Source map warning from @mediapipe/tasks-vision needs investigation

## Pending Tasks
1. Implement point cloud editing functionality
2. Add export capabilities
3. Enhance selection tools with:
   - Multiple selection support
   - Selection inversion
   - Selection saving
4. Add camera position presets
5. Implement view reset functionality
6. Add keyboard shortcuts
7. Improve touch controls for mobile devices

## Code Examples

### Point Cloud Rendering
```typescript
const geometry = useMemo(() => {
  const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();
  
  const positions = new Float32Array(data.points.length * 3);
  const colors = new Float32Array(data.points.length * 3);

  data.points.forEach((point, index) => {
    const i = index * 3;
    positions[i] = point.position[0];
    positions[i + 1] = point.position[1];
    positions[i + 2] = point.position[2];
    
    colors[i] = point.color[0] / 255;
    colors[i + 1] = point.color[1] / 255;
    colors[i + 2] = point.color[2] / 255;
  });

  geometry.setAttribute('position', new THREE.BufferAttribute(positions, 3));
  geometry.setAttribute('color', new THREE.BufferAttribute(colors, 3));
  
  return geometry;
}, [data]);
```

### Selection Tools Implementation
```typescript
function SelectionOverlay({ 
  activeTool, 
  brushSize = 20,
  onPointsSelected 
}: { 
  activeTool: string | null;
  brushSize?: number;
  onPointsSelected?: (points: THREE.Vector3[]) => void;
}) {
  // ... implementation details in Viewer3D.tsx
}
```

## Development Guidelines
1. Maintain Blender-like UX for familiarity
2. Prioritize performance with large point clouds
3. Keep UI clean and minimal
4. Ensure proper resource cleanup
5. Follow TypeScript best practices
6. Maintain responsive design

## Future Enhancements
1. Support for more file formats
2. Point cloud editing tools
3. Measurement tools
4. Animation support
5. Custom shaders for enhanced visualization
6. Collaboration features
7. Project saving and loading
8. Command palette for quick actions

## Notes
- The application uses a modular architecture for easy expansion
- All UI components are designed to be reusable
- Performance is a key consideration in all implementations
- The codebase is set up for easy testing and maintenance
